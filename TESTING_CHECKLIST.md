## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: CHANNEL_ERROR in console
**Solution:**
1. Enable Realtime in Supabase Dashboard (Database → Replication)
2. Check RLS policies allow SELECT on messages and reactions
3. Verify Supabase project is active

**Solution:**
1. Check console for subscription status
2. Verify Realtime is enabled for messages table
3. Run: `ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE messages;`

**Solution:**
1. Check Realtime is enabled for reactions table
2. Run: `ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE reactions;`

**Solution:**
1. Check UNIQUE constraint exists: `UNIQUE(message_id, user_id, emoji)`
